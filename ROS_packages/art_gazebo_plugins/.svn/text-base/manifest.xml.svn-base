       Contains a simplified Ackermann drive plugin. Simplified means that this plugin
       treats the Ackermann drive as a tricycle, setting the velocities of the rear
       drive wheels and setting the steering angle of a single steering joint. It is
       assumed that the Gazebo description of the robot links two steerable wheels
       to the steered joint in a fashion similar to the provided example robot model
       in urdf/ackermann.urdf.xacro. The purpose of this custom plugin is to
       build the ROS functionality directly into a proper Gazebo plugin, rather than
       a node that communicates with Gazebo.
